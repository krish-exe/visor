# visor
Ai for Bharat submission repository

Visor is a lightweight, selection-driven assistant that appears directly over the material a user is reading. Instead of switching tabs or uploading notes, users can highlight text or select a diagram to open a contextual AI chat that provides explanations, summaries, solutions, or visual insights in real time.

The system focuses only on the selected content, creating a distraction-free learning experience while preserving the user’s reading flow. It supports both text and diagram understanding and can operate across webpages, PDFs, and other on-screen study materials with minimal setup.
